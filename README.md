# Alexa (Using python)
This Python-based voice assistant project integrates several powerful libraries to allow users to interact via voice or text input. Leveraging speech_recognition for voice command processing, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech feedback, pywhatkit for web automation tasks like playing YouTube videos, wikipedia for retrieving quick summaries from Wikipedia, and pyjokes for generating jokes, this project creates a versatile and user-friendly assistant. Users can choose their input method, making it adaptable to various environments. Whether playing music, fetching current time, or providing information and entertainment, this assistant is designed to be both functional and engaging. Setup involves simple steps such as cloning the repository, installing dependencies, and running the script, making it accessible for users looking to explore and extend its capabilities. This project serves as an excellent foundation for anyone interested in developing their own voice-activated applications.
